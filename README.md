BST Visualizer

BST Visualizer is an interactive tool for exploring Binary Search Trees (BSTs). It provides a graphical representation of BST operations, allowing users to visualize insertion and deletion as well as traversal order of the binary search tree i.e. inorder, preorder, and postorder traversal.

Features
Interactive Visualization: Explore BST operations through an intuitive graphical interface.
Insertion and Deletion: Add and remove nodes dynamically to observe changes in the tree structure.
Traversal : in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal .
